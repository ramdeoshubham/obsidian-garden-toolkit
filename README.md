Welcome to **Obsidian Garden Toolkit** !

This is an obsidian vault which contains all the stuff you need to begin planting your digital garden! I have handpicked the theme, the plugins and configured the settings as I have found to be comfortable for many years of using obsidian every day.

Hope you will enjoy it üòÑ

- To use it, simply download and open the "notes" folder as a new vault from the Obsidian App. That's it !
- You can always copy ".obsidian" and overwrite it on the existing ".obsidian" folder of your Vault. (make sure hidden files are visible on your operating system)
