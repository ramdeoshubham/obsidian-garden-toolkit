Welcome to **Obsidian Garden Toolkit** !

This is an obsidian vault which contains all the stuff you need to begin planting your digital garden! I have handpicked the theme, the plugins and configured the settings as I have found to be comfortable for many years of using obsidian every day.

Hope you will enjoy it 😄
